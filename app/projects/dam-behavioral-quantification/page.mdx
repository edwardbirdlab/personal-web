## Introduction

Understanding the behavioral ecology of disease vectors is crucial for predicting transmission dynamics and developing control strategies. Drosophila Activity Monitors (DAM) provide a high-resolution, automated approach to quantify insect activity patterns, including circadian rhythms, locomotor activity, and behavioral responses to environmental stimuli.

This project applied DAM technology to study *Culicoides sonorensis* behavior, particularly focusing on how arbovirus infection alters activity patterns and circadian rhythms.

## Methods and Results

### DAM System Setup

The DAM system monitors individual insect activity through:

- **Infrared beam detection**: Recording beam breaks as flies move through glass tubes
- **Continuous monitoring**: 24/7 data collection over days to weeks
- **Environmental control**: Precise temperature and light cycle regulation
- **High-throughput capacity**: Simultaneous monitoring of 32+ individuals per system

### Circadian Rhythm Analysis

Behavioral metrics quantified include:

- **Activity patterns**: Total movement counts per time bin
- **Circadian periodicity**: Free-running period length under constant conditions
- **Phase relationships**: Timing of activity onset relative to light cycles
- **Amplitude**: Robustness of rhythmic activity
- **Fragmentation**: Distribution of activity and rest bouts

### Effects of Virus Infection

VSV-infected *C. sonorensis* exhibited:

- **Altered circadian rhythms**: Changes in period length and phase
- **Reduced activity levels**: Overall decrease in locomotor activity
- **Disrupted sleep/rest patterns**: Fragmentation of rest periods
- **Time-dependent changes**: Progressive behavioral alterations post-infection

### Integration with Transcriptomics

Correlation between behavioral changes and gene expression revealed:

- Downregulation of circadian clock genes (*period*, *timeless*, *clock*)
- Altered expression of neurotransmitter receptors
- Changes in metabolic genes affecting energy availability
- Modulation of neuro-sensory pathways

## Discussion and Future Work

### Biological Significance

Behavioral alterations may:

1. **Enhance transmission**: Infected midges may alter host-seeking behavior
2. **Reduce fitness**: Activity changes could impact survival and reproduction
3. **Indicate infection status**: Behavioral biomarkers for surveillance
4. **Reflect neuro-manipulation**: Evidence of pathogen manipulation of host behavior

### Methodological Advances

DAM system provides:

- Objective, quantitative behavioral measurements
- High temporal resolution (minute-level data)
- Long-term monitoring capability
- Applicability to various insect species

### Future Directions

Planned studies include:

- **Additional virus systems**: Testing BTV and EHDV effects on behavior
- **Dose-response relationships**: Quantifying effects of viral load
- **Environmental modulation**: Testing temperature and humidity effects
- **Pharmacological interventions**: Probing molecular mechanisms with drugs
- **Field validation**: Comparing lab and field-collected midge behavior
- **Other vector species**: Extending to mosquitoes and other disease vectors

### Applications

This approach supports:

- Vector competence assessment
- Insecticide efficacy testing
- Environmental risk assessment
- Basic neurobiology research
- Behavioral manipulation studies

*Activity plots, periodograms, and circadian rhythm visualizations will be added.*
