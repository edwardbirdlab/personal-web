## Introduction

This project leverages house flies as innovative xenosurveillance tools for monitoring pathogens and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in agricultural environments. House flies are ubiquitous in livestock operations and have frequent contact with various contamination sources, making them ideal biological samplers for environmental surveillance.

The **BALROG** (Bacterial AntimicrobiaL Resistance annOtation of Genomes) pipeline suite was developed to facilitate high-throughput metagenomic analysis of antimicrobial resistance genes and pathogens from both metagenomic samples (BALROG-MON) and bacterial isolates (BALROG-ISO).

## Methods and Results

### BALROG-MON Pipeline Development

BALROG-MON is a Nextflow-based pipeline designed for Oxford Nanopore metagenomic sequencing data. The pipeline:

- Performs quality control and adapter trimming
- Conducts taxonomic classification of reads
- Assembles metagenomes and bins contigs
- Annotates antimicrobial resistance genes using multiple databases (ResFinder, CARD, MEGARes)
- Identifies virulence factors and mobile genetic elements
- Generates comprehensive reports with visualizations

The pipeline uses Apptainer/Docker containerization for reproducibility and can be deployed on HPC clusters or cloud infrastructure.

### BALROG-ISO Pipeline Development

BALROG-ISO focuses on whole-genome sequencing of bacterial isolates, providing:

- Genome assembly and quality assessment
- Comprehensive AMR gene annotation
- Plasmid identification and characterization
- Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST)
- Phylogenetic analysis capabilities

### House Fly Surveillance Studies

Using these pipelines, we have conducted extensive surveillance at Kansas beef and dairy cattle operations:

- Detected multi-drug resistant bacteria mirroring environmental sources
- Identified clinically relevant AMR genes in *Escherichia coli* and other pathogens
- Demonstrated site-specific AMR patterns correlating with antibiotic use
- Provided evidence for flies as vectors and sentinels of resistance

Recent work detected highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 in house flies during the 2024 California outbreak, demonstrating the utility of this approach for emerging pathogen surveillance.

## Discussion and Future Work

### Current Findings

Our metagenomic surveillance approach has proven highly effective for:

1. **Real-time monitoring** of AMR in agricultural settings
2. **Early detection** of emerging pathogens
3. **Risk assessment** for human and animal health
4. **Tracking** the spread of resistance genes across environments

### Future Directions

Ongoing and planned work includes:

- **Insecticide resistance monitoring**: Extending the framework to track pesticide resistance genes in arthropod pests
- **Geospatial mapping**: Developing predictive models for AMR distribution
- **Expanded pathogen panels**: Incorporating viral and fungal pathogen detection
- **Machine learning integration**: Automated risk assessment and outbreak prediction
- **Multi-site validation**: Testing the approach across diverse agricultural systems
- **Force health protection**: Applying xenosurveillance to military and biosecurity contexts

### Impact

This work provides a novel, cost-effective approach to biosurveillance that can inform:

- Antimicrobial stewardship programs
- Biosecurity risk assessments
- Public health interventions
- Agricultural management practices
