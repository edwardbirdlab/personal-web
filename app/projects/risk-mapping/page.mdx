## Why Flies for Surveillance?

Filth flies are natural biological sensors. They're drawn to microbe-rich environments like animal waste and decaying organic matter—exactly where pathogens concentrate. As flies move through these environments, they collect microorganisms on their bodies and in their digestive systems, essentially sampling their environment continuously.

What makes this approach powerful:

- **Autonomous sampling**: Flies do the work without us having to know exactly where to look
- **Representative coverage**: Fly microbiomes accurately reflect their environment in both time and space
- **Early warning system**: Detects emerging threats before they become widespread
- **Works anywhere**: Particularly valuable in novel or understudied environments

## From Flies to Actionable Intelligence

The workflow is straightforward:

1. **Collection**: Flies are collected and pooled by site and date
2. **Sequencing**: DNA/RNA extraction and metagenomic sequencing captures all genetic material
3. **Analysis**: Custom pipelines identify microorganisms, pathogens, and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) with confidence scores
4. **Risk Assessment**: Multiple factors—pathogen type, detection confidence, and context—feed into an adjustable risk model

This approach eliminates time-consuming lab cultures and provides comprehensive threat detection including both pathogens and resistance genes that could compromise treatment.

## Interactive Risk Dashboard

To make surveillance data accessible, we developed an interactive dashboard that visualizes risk patterns across all monitored sites. The tool helps stakeholders quickly understand pathogen and resistance profiles, track changes over time, and prioritize resources where threats are highest.

**Important Note:** The locations shown in this example dashboard were chosen at random, and all data including risk scores are randomized for demonstration purposes only. This is simply an example of the interface functionality. The dashboard will be updated with real samples and data upon publication when the work is formally released.

### Using the Dashboard

**Map Panel**: Zoomable heatmap with warmer colors indicating higher risk. Click any marker to view site details.

**Data Tabs** (right panel):
- **Pathogens**: Detected organisms with health risk categories, confidence scores (0-100), and relative risk
- **ARG Classes**: Distribution of antibiotic resistance classes with gene counts
- **ARGs**: Individual resistance genes with antibiotic class and detection confidence

## Optimizing Detection Sensitivity

**The Challenge**: In many samples, 90-99% of sequence data comes from fly DNA/RNA rather than microbial content, requiring deep sequencing to confidently detect pathogens.

**Current Progress**: We're developing sample preparation methods to reduce host contamination and enrich for microbial sequences. Early results show substantial improvements in microbial sequence recovery, which will lower per-sample costs and improve detection sensitivity for routine surveillance.

## Beyond Flies: A Modular Framework

While this project focuses on filth flies, the entire framework is designed for flexibility:

**Sample Types**: The pipeline accommodates any sample type—mosquitoes, ticks, environmental swabs, soil samples—enabling multi-source surveillance simultaneously.

**Adjustable Risk Models**: Parameters can be tuned for specific objectives (e.g., maximizing sensitivity vs. minimizing false positives). Future versions will allow real-time parameter adjustment through the dashboard.

**Data Integration**: The dashboard can incorporate diverse data sources including public health records, case reports, and environmental monitoring for comprehensive situational awareness.

## Applications

This surveillance framework provides early warning for pathogenic threats and AMR patterns before they become widespread. Key applications:

- **Military operations**: Threat assessment in deployment sites and forward operating bases
- **Border security**: Monitoring cross-border pathogen movement
- **Agriculture**: AMR mapping in livestock production
- **Disaster response**: Rapid assessment when traditional infrastructure is compromised
- **Public health**: Early warning systems for urban and rural populations

The accessible dashboard interface enables proactive decision-making for disease prevention and public health preparedness.
